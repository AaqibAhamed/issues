Casbin is an authorization library that supports access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC for Golang, Java, PHP and Node.js. It is a free and open source project hosted on GitHub under the Apache-2.0 license. This project starts from April 2017 and now Casbin's main library for Golang has already got nearly 3,000 stars on GitHub. Our Java and Node.js versions also have 400+ and 100+ stars. In the first few months, it is primarily myself to develop this project, but now we have built a core developer team to advance our projects, including the Node.js version node-Casbin, the server-side version Casbin-Server. Our project has many famous adopters, like Intel, VMware, Docker, Cisco, etc and many contributors from companies like Verizon, Microsoft, etc.

Now we have rebuilt our official website: casbin.org with Docusaurus. We want our website to support multiple languages instead of English only. We think Crowdin is a very good tool to help our project in internationalization.
